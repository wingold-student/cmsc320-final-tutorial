    "This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the perceptions, grades, and reviews of computer science and business management undergraduate students at the University of Maryland, College Park. To achieve these means, we applied various data scraping, data processing, machine learning, and data visualization and analysis techniques we learned throughout the semester, and hope to demonstrate a deep understanding of data science techniques and the data science lifecycle. We also employed natural language processing and statistical analysis to draw conclusions and answer key questions. We will illustrate the major trends in student perception of core classes and professors (how favorable certain professors are, or how hard a class may be), and we will draw generalized conclusions about the trends we observe over time (is a major getting easier? more likable?).

    "This project was sparked by interest in a question that all undergraduate students, at one point or another, face: How do my peers experience the core courses that all prospective students in my major are required to take? We hope that, by aggregating and conducting analysis of reviews and data available on major course-review websites such as PlanetTerp and RateMyProfessor, we would be able to grasp a data informed perspective to answer this question. Erik, one of the group members, is also a dual degree undergraduate student, enrolled in both the Computer Science and Business schools at UMD, and was interested in comparing student perceptions between these two majors."

We can also retrieve important characteristics including professor stats, reviews and course grades through pandas dataframes. In addition, based on these characteristics, we can also insert and retrieve review sentiments for each professor. In the RateMyProfessors database, we created tables to store data for professor statistics, reviews, review tags, and professor tags. In the PlanetTerp database, we created tables to store data for statistics, reviews, and grades."

Meanwhile, on the business side, we are collecting data for intro courses BMGT110, BMGT220, BMGT221, and BMGT230. We start by grabbing a general list of professors and the courses they offer at UMD. Then, we are able to map each professor to the introductory courses mentioned above that they offer by creating a dictionary of professor to courses. Lastly, we can separate the professors into their specific department to create a list of CMSC and BMGT professors."

Then we obtain the URL of each professor in order to parse their overall information such as their corresponding statistics and tags. We then utilize the Selenium browser to load all the different professor reviews which are continuously loaded since RateMyProfessors paginates the reviews via Javascript. For each review, we parse specific utilities including ratings, tags, thumb scoring, etc. Once the utilities are parsed, we obtain the overall statistics for each professor based on their reviews and store it in a dataframe. To wrap up the RateMyProfessors data collection we filter out the CMSC professors and reviews from the BMGT professors and reviews.\n"

    "Here, we collect data from our second source, the PlanetTerp API. This API is slightly different from the RateMyProfessors website because it does not contain tags to describe each professor. Instead, we collect stats, reviews, and grade data from PlanetTerp. We parse each individual review and place it into a dictionary. We place those that correspond to the introductory courses we are looking at into a separate data frame. Then we are able to query the API to obtain the stats and reviews for a given professor placing them into separate data frames. More functionality is added on this data such as summing semester grades, accumulating course grades and returning a data frame consisting of those. As we did with RateMyProfessors, we filter out the data for the CMSC professors and reviews from the BMGT professors and reviews."

    "It is worthy to consider possible sources of bias inside our data set. One bias at play is self-selection bias -- the bias that people who have had negative experiences are more likely to respond on surveys or polls. In the case of RateMyProfessor, this is almost certainly influential -- students who received their first bad grade, or first conflict with a professor, are more likely to express and vent their frustration than students who have had relatively plain or positive experiences. Furthermore, the aggregate of all reviews from each major yielded about 2x more CS students than BMGT students (726 CS to 387 BMGT) -- for one reason or another, CS students are more represented on these online websites (participation bias). Although we normalized for these (accounting for percentages of reviews positive/negative, rather than total counts), the sample size may not be perfectly representative of the population as a whole.
