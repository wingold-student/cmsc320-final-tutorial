    "This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the perceptions, grades, and reviews of computer science and business management undergraduate students at the University of Maryland, College Park. To achieve these means, we applied various data scraping, data processing, machine learning, and data visualization and analysis techniques we learned throughout the semester, and hope to demonstrate a deep understanding of data science techniques and the data science lifecycle. We also employed natural language processing and statistical analysis to draw conclusions and answer key questions. We will illustrate the major trends in student perception of core classes and professors (how favorable certain professors are, or how hard a class may be), and we will draw generalized conclusions about the trends we observe over time (is a major getting easier? more likable?).

    "This project was sparked by interest in a question that all undergraduate students, at one point or another, face: How do my peers experience the core courses that all prospective students in my major are required to take? We hope that, by aggregating and conducting analysis of reviews and data available on major course-review websites such as PlanetTerp and RateMyProfessor, we would be able to grasp a data informed perspective to answer this question. Erik, one of the group members, is also a dual degree undergraduate student, enrolled in both the Computer Science and Business schools at UMD, and was interested in comparing student perceptions between these two majors."

    "We have created two separate database systems for RateMyProfessors and PlanetTerp accordingly to hold data scraped from both of these sites. Additionally, we have separated CMSC and BMGT data - so we have a total of 4 databases. We have generic database functionality such as checking if all the data has been scraped for a certain professor. We can also retrieve important characteristics including professor stats, reviews and course grades through pandas dataframes. In addition, based on these characteristics, we can also insert and retrieve review sentiments for each professor. In the RateMyProfessors database, we created tables to store data for professor statistics, reviews, review tags, and professor tags. In the PlanetTerp database, we created tables to store data for statistics, reviews, and grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) with Python for the storage. Since the data scraped from RateMyProfessor and PlanetTerp was relatively small, this offered a nice solution. Additionally, it made data storage easier to manage, since it was all local to our development. The separation was done preemptively to make the databases even more small and managable, along with just to keep a separation of data. However, choosing to only use one or two databases is perfectly fine as well, just not the route we opted for in this tutorial. Tutorials for SQLite in Python [can be found here](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/), if you want further information.\n",

However, it is recommended you rely upon the databases, unless you want to scrape newer data or wish to experiment with the scraping, parsing and querying yourself."

Both `professor_stats` share the use of the name of the professor, number of reviews, and overall rating. Similarly, both `reviews` tables have a review id, full name of the professor being rated, a date, course, body, and sentiment data. The `grades` table refers to data queried through the `https://api.planetterp.com/v1/grades` endpoint, which allows querying for the grade distribution per course.

Readubg and writing of this data was done through [Python's DictReader and DictWriter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html).

However, RateMyProfessor does **not** offer an API to query for their reviews as a JSON. Therefore, the website must be scraped manually. \n",

Then we obtain the URL of the professor's page in order to parse their overall information such as their corresponding statistics and tags.\n",

    "First, the professor statistics. This includes their name, overall rating, number of ratings, percetange of who would take again, and the average level of difficulty reported. \n",
    "This data goes into the `professor_stats` table. The professor tags are also parsed and placed into the `professor_tags` table. Scraping of this data is all achievable with only the `requests` python library and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library. \n",

    "Second, the professor's reviews. We utilize the [Selenium browser](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) to load all the professor reviews which are continuously loaded since RateMyProfessors paginates the reviews via Javascript. Once all reviews are loaded, the HTML data for the list of reviews is scraped, then handed off for parsing by BeautifulSoup. For each review, we parse every part of the review including ratings, tags, thumb scoring, etc. The review's text, rating, difficulty, course, thumb scoring, post date, and professor name are all saved into the `reviews` table. Review meta tags, such as `Online Class: Yes` or `Grade: A` are stored in `meta_tags`. The review's tags used to describe the professor are stored in the `review_tags` table.\n",

The `Quality` and `Difficulty` ratings describe the student's experience of the professor and course, and are parsed in `parse_rating_data`. Each reviewer has the option of attaching tags that describe the professor and course, such as `Gives good feedback` in the image. The review tags are parsed with `parse_review_tags`. Reviews can be liked or disliked via the thumbs up and down. This data is parsed with `parse_thumb_scoring`. **Finally**, the review body is parsed through `parse_review_text`.

This is a vastly different approach than with RateMyProfessor, because we do not actually have to load PlanetTerp's HTML pages in order to get data. Instead we send a GET request to URL ([an endpoint](https://api.planetterp.com/#get-courses)) and receive back data in a [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). To handle this, we make use of [Python's requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/).\n",

Each JSON contains general professor statistics and data, along with a list of reviews. We parse each individual review and place it into a dictionary. We place those that correspond to the introductory courses we are looking at into a dataframe, which will hold all desired reviews. We also placed professor statistics into a separate dataframe. Both dataframes are saved to the database.\n",

    "With these graphs we can see that CMSC has BMGT 'beat' in both the reviews and professors rated count department. The left graph shows that there are roughly double the amount of reviews for CMSC courses than there are for BMGT courses. Additionally, the right graph shows that roughly double the amount of CMSC professors have been reviewed than BMGT professors. Again, this data is aggregated from both PlanetTerp and RateMyProfessor. We have also queried for the same amount of courses.\n",

    "We could infer this to mean that CMSC students are more likely to be posting reviews. It could also just mean that there are more CMSC students, and thus there are more reviews from them. Without exact numbers of the population of CMSC and BMGT students, it makes the comparison a little difficult. But it does give some insight into which major you're more likely to find reviews for the professor or course you want."

This grade data is strictly from scraped reviews with a reported grade in the range A+ to W. We'd also like to note that we have removed the reported grades of 'Other' or 'Rather not say.'"

    "These graphs depict the grade count of majors over the years, as reported from RateMyProfessor and PlanetTerp. Interestingly, for most years, A seems to be the most frequent grade for CMSC student reviews. This does not hold for the BMGT major, where A drops to lower reported counts between 2011 and 2018. We should also point out that these graphs on the same scale, but as stated earlier, CMSC does have more reviews and reported grades. But from the data, it appears that CMSC reports better grades in the A range. However, we also see a larger gap between the grade frequency in CMSC, especially evident in 2018 through 2020. Overall, A count seems to have an increasing trend in CMSC, while such a trend is not present in BMGT and it remains mostly steady."

    "With these graphs we can see the dispersion of reviews over time. The first graph is by month, regardless of the year. We see most reviews seem to be posted in December and May, for both majors. May marks the end of the the Spring semester and December marks the end of the Fall semester, so this is not all too surprising. This lines up roughly with the reviews posted per semester, as seen in the second graph. Not all too surprising, but no reviews were posted in the short amount of time that is the Winter semester (January 1st start date to roughly January 20th). Thus, the first two graphs definitely have a bimodal distribution. Lastly, we show the amount of reviews posted per yer in the last graph. We see an increasing trend over the years for CMSC reviews posted, although BMGT reviews tend to have little variation. These last 2-3 years for CMSC has certainly seen a boom in reviews."

    "These graphs depict the dispersion of ratings given to professors by students of each major over the years. While there is higher dispersion in the earlier years, such as from 2004 to 2013, we see it start to level out to around a rating 3.0 in both majors. Skewed dispersions, such as in 2004 in both graphs or 2009 and 2013 of BMGT can be explained by the low amount of reviews those years (as seen in the graph above). We've also plotted the average and median professor rating for each major. Due to their close similarity, there is likely no high amount of outliers skewing the data (though this can be interpreted from the boxplots as well). So, it appears both majors have arrived roughly at the same professor rating by 2020."

    "It is worthy to consider possible sources of bias inside our data set. One bias at play is self-selection bias -- the bias that people who have had negative experiences are more likely to respond on surveys or polls. In the case of RateMyProfessor, this is almost certainly influential -- students who received their first bad grade, or first conflict with a professor, are more likely to express and vent their frustration than students who have had relatively plain or positive experiences. Furthermore, the aggregate of all reviews from each major yielded about 2x more CS students than BMGT students (726 CS to 387 BMGT) -- for one reason or another, CS students are more represented on these online websites (participation bias). Although we normalized for these (accounting for percentages of reviews positive/negative, rather than total counts), the sample size may not be perfectly representative of the population as a whole.
